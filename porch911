<b>The Porsche 911 (pronounced Nine Eleven or in German: Neunelf)</b>
is a two-door 2+2 high performance rear-engined sports car introduced in September 1964 by Porsche AG of Stuttgart, Germany.
It has a rear-mounted flat-six engine and originally a torsion bar suspension.
The car has been continuously enhanced through the years but the basic concept has remained unchanged.
The engines were air-cooled until the introduction of the 996 series in 1998.
